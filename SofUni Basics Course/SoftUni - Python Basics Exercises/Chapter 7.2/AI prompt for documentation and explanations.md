tutor help 

- this the latest problem I am solving can you pleasedon't yet give me the solution but give me some help and guidance and act as my tutor that cares for me to succeed and be good at coding


- I need your help with python, I need you to act as my tutor and help me with key concepts, explaining and documenting each line of the code and exercises. Summarise key points and make recommendations for improvement and where I fall short.

Problem with digits py

Evaluation (Out of 10): 2/10
What Was Correct (✓):
Basic input handling

Attempt at implementing divisibility checks

Understanding that different operations were needed

Major Issues (✗):
Wrong variable types (using strings instead of integers)

Incorrect divisibility checks (using / instead of %)

Wrong range in loop (should use input number)

No digit extraction implementation

Incorrect calculation of N and M

No grid creation

Wrong output format

Detailed Breakdown:
Variable Usage (1/10)

Using strings (result='') for numerical operations

Can't perform arithmetic with strings as planned

Logic Implementation (2/10)

Divisibility checks incorrect

Loop structure doesn't match problem requirements

Missing core functionality

Problem Understanding (3/10)

Basic grasp of needing to check divisibility

Missed understanding of grid creation

Missed understanding of number modification rules

Recommendations for Improvement:
Study string vs integer operations

Practice digit extraction from numbers

Review modulo operator (%)

Study nested loops for grid creation

Practice breaking down complex problems into smaller steps

Would you like to see how to implement any of these improvements?
