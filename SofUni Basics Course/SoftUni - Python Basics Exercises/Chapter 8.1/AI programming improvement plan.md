Based on your current level and the challenges you're facing, here are specific practice recommendations:

1. Strengthen Fundamentals (1-2 weeks)
Conditional Logic:

Write programs that use nested if-else statements to classify items based on multiple criteria

Practice problems where you need to combine multiple conditions with AND/OR logic

Create a simple "choose your own adventure" program with branching paths

Loops:

Write programs that process data over multiple iterations (like calculating averages)

Practice using loop counters and conditional statements inside loops

Implement problems that require tracking running totals or finding patterns

Integer Division and Modulo:

Create programs that group items (like the bee problem does with groups of 10, 20, 50)

Practice problems involving cycles (like "every 5th item is special")

Write code that converts between different units (hours to days/weeks, etc.)

2. Simulation Practice (2-3 weeks)
Simple Simulations:

Create a bank account simulator that tracks balance over time with deposits/withdrawals

Build a simple population growth model with just one rule (like 5% growth per year)

Implement a basic game score tracker that changes based on different events

Multi-step Simulations:

Write a program that simulates plant growth with factors like water, sunlight, and fertilizer

Create a simple economy simulator where prices change based on supply and demand

Build a fitness tracker that calculates progress based on different types of exercises

3. Problem-Solving Techniques (Ongoing)
Breaking Down Problems:

Take complex problems and write out the steps in plain language before coding

Practice identifying the variables you need to track in a problem

For each problem, identify the "state" that changes and how it changes

Tracing Code:

Take working solutions and add print statements to show the state after each step

Manually trace through code with small examples, writing down variable values

Practice predicting the output of code before running it

4. Specific Projects to Try
Modified Beehive Simulator: Start with just births and deaths, then add the migration rule

Simple Game: Create a number guessing game with hints and a score tracker

Grade Calculator: Build a program that calculates final grades based on multiple assignments with different weights

Shopping Cart: Implement a program that tracks items, quantities, and applies different discount rules

5. Study Habits
Spend 15-20 minutes daily reviewing concepts you've learned

When you encounter a problem you can't solve, try to solve a simpler version first

Keep a programming journal where you write down what you've learned and challenges you've overcome

Remember, consistent practice with gradually increasing complexity will help you build confidence and skills more effectively than rushing through many concepts quickly.

- AI's concepts to revist and to improve your programming skills, you should practice in a structured way that builds on each concept:

Master the fundamentals first:

Practice basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)

Work on simple problems like the "Sum of Two Numbers" example1

Make sure you understand variable assignment and basic data types

Logic and conditional statements:

Practice problems like FizzBuzz1 that combine arithmetic with conditional logic

Work on exercises that require if/else decisions based on calculations

Link: https://daily.dev/blog/fun-coding-problems-from-easy-to-hard 

Single loops (for and while):

Start with simple counting exercises4

Practice problems like calculating averages from user input4

Try implementing a guessing game or Fibonacci sequence generator3

Nested loops:

Begin with pattern printing exercises (printing stars in rows and columns)56

Work on more complex patterns like pyramids1

Practice turtle graphics exercises with nested loops if available56

Combine all concepts:

Work on problems that require nested loops with conditional logic

Try implementing the challenges from the "Intermediate Challenges" section1

Additional Notes:

The progression suggests that nested loops are considered more advanced, as they require understanding of how loops work within other loops. Focus on mastering each concept thoroughly before moving to the next level.

For effective practice:

Solve multiple problems at each level before advancing

Trace through your code manually to understand execution flow

Experiment with modifying working solutions to see how changes affect the output

Practice explaining your solutions to reinforce understanding

- More important! 

Based on the problems you've been working on (beehive population, honey reserves, etc.), you're clearly well beyond basic arithmetic and simple variable assignments.

What you need is targeted practice on the specific areas where you're struggling:

Complex Problem Decomposition:

Practice breaking down multi-step problems like the beehive defense and honey reserves

Focus on identifying the sequence of operations and state changes

Loop Control and Logic:

Work on problems with complex loop exit conditions

Practice nested loops where the inner loop depends on outer loop variables

Simulation Problems:

Find more problems that simulate processes over time (like the beehive population)

Practice tracking multiple changing variables through iterations

Edge Case Handling:

Focus on identifying and handling special conditions in your code

Practice problems where certain inputs trigger different behaviors

Instead of going back to basics, you need more structured practice at your current level with immediate feedback. Try to find problems similar to the ones you're struggling with, but with solutions and explanations available so you can compare your approach.

The key is not more practice on fundamentals, but rather developing a systematic approach to complex problems and improving your ability to translate problem statements into working code.
