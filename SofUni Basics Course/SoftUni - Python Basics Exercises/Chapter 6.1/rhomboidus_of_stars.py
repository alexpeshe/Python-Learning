# Detailed Pattern Breakdown:
# For n = 5, the pattern would look like:

#    * *
#   * * *
#  * * * *
# * * * * *
#  * * * *
#   * * *
#    * *
#     *

# Pattern Creation Logic:
# 1. Upper Half (row <= n):
#    - Spaces decrease from n-1 to 0
#    - Stars increase from 1 to n
#    - Right-aligned triangular pattern

# 2. Lower Half (row > n):
#    - Spaces increase from 0 to n-1
#    - Stars decrease from n to 1
#    - Maintains symmetry with upper half

# Key Variables:
# n: Size of the diamond
# space: Calculates leading spaces
# star: Tracks number of stars
# sec_part_star: Controls stars in lower half
# row: Current row being processed

# Mathematical Insights:
# - Total rows = 2n - 1
# - Upper half: rows 1 to n
# - Lower half: rows n+1 to 2n-1
# - Symmetrical pattern around middle row

# Variations to Explore:
# - Change star character
# - Modify space/star calculations
# - Add color or formatting

Comprehensive Explanation:

Input and Initialization

User inputs diamond size n
Sets up initial variables for pattern creation
sec_part_star starts at n-1 for symmetry
Pattern Creation Logic

Single loop from 1 to 2n
Divided into two parts: upper and lower halves
Upper Half Mechanics

space = n - row: Calculates leading spaces
Decreases spaces as rows increase
Right-aligns the pattern
Creates triangular shape
Lower Half Mechanics

space = row - n: Calculates leading spaces
Increases spaces as rows decrease
Maintains symmetry with upper half
Decreases stars with each row
Space and Star Calculation

Dynamic calculation based on current row
Ensures symmetrical diamond shape
Precise control over pattern geometry

# Color variation
def print_colored_diamond(n, color='\033[91m'):  # Red color
    for row in range(1, 2*n):
        if row <= n:
            space = n - row
            print(color + ' '* space + '* ' * row + '\033[0m')
        else:
            space = row - n
            print(color + ' ' * space + '* ' * (n - (space)) + '\033[0m')

# Custom character variation
def print_custom_diamond(n, char='#'):
    for row in range(1, 2*n):
        if row <= n:
            space = n - row
            print(' '* space + f'{char} ' * row)
        else:
            space = row - n
            print(' ' * space + f'{char} ' * (n - space))
Potential Improvements:

Add input validation
Allow custom characters
Implement color options
Handle different diamond sizes
Common Challenges:

Maintaining symmetry
Precise space calculations
Handling different input sizes
Recommended Practice:

Experiment with different values of n
Try custom characters
Understand the mathematical pattern
