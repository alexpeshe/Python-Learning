Breaking Down the Code
Step 1: We gather all the inputs from the user.
Step 2: Calculate W, which is the total water filled in H hours.
Step 3: Use an if condition to check if the pool is overflowing:
If the total water (W) is less than or equal to V, we calculate how full the pool is in percentages.
If the pool is overflowing (W > V), we calculate the overflow.
Step 4: Output the results with formatted strings.
Why Use math.trunc?
The function math.trunc() ensures that the percentages are displayed as whole numbers. So, for example, 66.67% will become 66%, making it more readable.
Practice to Build Confidence!
I know conditionals can feel tricky at first. But once you break down the logic step-by-step, it gets much easier. I suggest testing this with different inputs to see how the code behaves. Focus on small successes to build momentum, and Iâ€™ll always be here to help guide you through it! ðŸ˜„
