# Tips for solving the task:
# bfly_width = 2*n-1 columns
# bfly_height = 2*(n-2)+1
# left_right = n-1

# Read the input size for the butterfly pattern
n = int(input())

# Calculate the size of the wing (excluding the body)
# Subtract 2 to create space for the body and middle section
stars = n - 2

# Draw the top half of the butterfly
# Use integer division (n//2) to determine the number of rows
for row in range(0, (n//2)-1):
    # First row type: Asterisk rows with outward-facing slashes
    # Creates the wing with '*' characters and '\' slash pointing outwards
    print('*'*stars + '\\' + ' ' + '/' + '*'*stars)
    
    # Second row type: Dash rows with outward-facing slashes
    # Creates a textured effect with '-' characters
    print('-'*stars + '\\' + ' ' + '/' + '-'*stars)

# Draw the body of the butterfly
# Center the '@' symbol with equal spaces on both sides
print(' '*stars + ' ' + '@' + ' '*stars)

# Draw the bottom half of the butterfly
# Symmetrical to the top half, but with reversed slashes
for row in range(0, (n//2)-1):
    # First row type: Asterisk rows with inward-facing slashes
    # Creates the wing with '*' characters and '/' slash pointing inwards
    print('*'*stars + '/' + ' ' + '\\' + '*'*stars)
    
    # Second row type: Dash rows with inward-facing slashes
    # Creates a textured effect with '-' characters
    print('-'*stars + '/' + ' ' + '\\' + '-'*stars)

# Commented out alternative loop (likely an earlier iteration)
# for row in range(0, ((n-2)//2)+1):
