# Prompt the user to input a number and convert it to an integer
n = int(input())

# Input validation loop
# Note: There's a logical error in the current condition
while not n<1 or n<100:
    # This prints an error message for invalid input
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and 100.")
    
    # Reprompt the user to enter a new number
    n = int(input())

# Print the final validated number
print('The number is: ' + str(n))

# Logical Analysis:
# The current condition `not n<1 or n<100` is problematic
# It will always evaluate to True, creating an infinite loop
# This means the loop will continue regardless of the input

# Correct Condition Should Be:
# while n < 1 or n > 100:
#     print("Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and 100.")
#     n = int(input())

# Corrected Logic:
# 1. Check if the number is less than 1 OR greater than 100
# 2. If true, ask for input again
# 3. Continue until a valid number is entered

# Key Issues in Original Code:
# 1. Logical error in the while condition
# 2. The condition will always be True
# 3. Creates an infinite loop
# 4. Does not properly validate the input range

'''
# Recommended Correct Implementation:
def get_valid_input():
    while True:
        try:
            n = int(input("Enter a number between 1 and 100: "))
            if 1 <= n <= 100:
                return n
            else:
                print("Invalid input. Number must be between 1 and 100.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a valid integer.")'''

# Proper Input Validation Approach:
# 1. Use a while True loop
# 2. Add try-except to handle non-integer inputs
# 3. Check if number is within the specified range
# 4. Return the valid input
# 5. Provide clear error messages

# Best Practices:
# - Clear error messaging
# - Robust input validation
# - Handling potential input errors
# - Ensuring user gets correct input

Detailed Explanation:

Input Attempt
User is prompted to enter a number
Number is converted to integer using int(input())
Problematic Validation Loop
Current condition not n<1 or n<100 is logically flawed
Will always evaluate to True
Creates an infinite loop
Does not effectively validate input range
Logical Errors
not n<1 means the number is NOT less than 1
or n<100 is always true for any number
Result: Loop continues indefinitely
Intended Behavior (Corrected)
Validate number is between 1 and 100
Reprompt if number is outside range
Provide clear error guidance
Recommended Improvements
Use clear, precise condition
Add error handling
Provide meaningful feedback
Ensure robust input validatio

Alternative 
while not n >=1 and n <= 100:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and 100.")
    n = int(input())

'''  # This is also correct, but the first one is more clear and easier to understand.
