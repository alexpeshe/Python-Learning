# Prompt the user to input a number (note: the input is not used in this specific loop)
n = int(input())

# Initialize the starting number for the loop
start_num = 1

# While loop to print numbers from 1 to 10
while start_num <= 10:
    # Print the current value of start_num
    print(start_num)
    
    # Increment start_num by 1 in each iteration
    # This ensures the loop progresses towards the termination condition
    start_num += 1

# Detailed Breakdown of the Loop:

# Loop Mechanics:
# 1. Initial state: start_num = 1
# 2. Condition checked: Is start_num <= 10? Yes
# 3. Print 1
# 4. Increment start_num to 2
# 5. Repeat until start_num becomes 11

# Iteration Sequence:
# 1st iteration: prints 1, start_num becomes 2
# 2nd iteration: prints 2, start_num becomes 3
# ...
# 10th iteration: prints 10, start_num becomes 11
# Loop terminates because 11 is not <= 10

# Equivalent Alternative Using For Loop:
# for start_num in range(1, 11):
#     print(start_num)

# Key Characteristics:
# - Predictable iteration
# - Prints consecutive numbers
# - Fixed range (1 to 10)
# - Simple counter-based loop

# Important Observations:
# 1. The input 'n' is not used in the loop
# 2. The loop always prints numbers 1 to 10
# 3. Loop control is managed by start_num

# Potential Variations:
# 1. Change the start number
# start_num = 0  # would print 0 to 9
# 2. Change the upper limit
# while start_num <= 15:  # would print 1 to 15

# Performance Considerations:
# - While loops are flexible but can be error-prone
# - For loops are often preferred for known iteration ranges

# Recommended Practices:
# - Ensure clear loop termination condition
# - Increment/modify loop variable correctly
# - Avoid infinite loops

# Visual Representation of Loop:
# Iteration | start_num | Printed | Condition
# 1         | 1         | 1       | True
# 2         | 2         | 2       | True
# ...
# 10        | 10        | 10      | True
# 11        | 11        | Loop ends | False

# Common Use Cases:
# - Counting
# - Iterating a known number of times
# - Simple sequential processing

# Potential Improvements:
# 1. Make the range dynamic
# 2. Add error handling
# 3. Parameterize the start and end values

Comprehensive Analysis:

Loop Structure
Uses while loop for iteration
Controlled by start_num variable
Simple, straightforward counting mechanism
Loop Mechanics
Starts with start_num = 1
Continues while start_num <= 10
Prints current number
Increments start_num by 1 each iteration
Iteration Pattern
Predictable sequence
Prints numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., 10
Guaranteed termination
Input Handling
Takes an input n, but doesn't use it
Could be modified to make input meaningful
Comparison with For Loop
Equivalent to for start_num in range(1, 11)
While loop offers more manual control
For loop is more Pythonic for known ranges
Potential Enhancements
Dynamic range
Error handling
Input validation
Parameterized iteration
